# Project Sessions Log

## Session: 2025-01-31 23:00 - Project Initialization & MVP Implementation

**Previous context**: N/A - First session

**Today's goal**: 
- [x] Initialize Next.js 15 project with TypeScript and Tailwind
- [x] Set up session tracking system
- [x] Create CLAUDE.md documentation structure
- [x] Implement MVP for dynamic QR code application
- [x] Set up Supabase authentication
- [x] Configure PostgreSQL database with Prisma
- [x] Build basic QR code generation and link management

**Implementation notes**:
- Created Next.js 15.4.5 project with App Router, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS v4
- Used Node.js 24.2.0 with nodenv
- Implemented complete MVP with:
  - User authentication (email/password via Supabase)
  - Single QR code per user with dynamic redirects
  - Link page editor (max 5 links)
  - Basic scan tracking
  - Responsive UI
- Created modular folder structure separating features, components, lib, hooks, types, services
- Set up Prisma schema with User, QRCode, Link, and Scan models
- Implemented API routes for QR code creation, link updates, and scan tracking

**Blockers/Issues**:
- Initial Supabase connection issues - resolved by:
  - Creating proper .env.local configuration
  - Using pooled connection string for Prisma
  - URL-encoding special characters in database password
- Middleware needed update to handle missing environment variables gracefully

**Completed**:
- [x] Project structure created with scalable folder organization
- [x] Session tracking system established
- [x] Database schema designed and migrated
- [x] Authentication flow (login/signup/logout)
- [x] QR code generation with react-qr-code
- [x] Dynamic link page (Linktree-style)
- [x] Scan tracking with IP hashing for privacy
- [x] Dashboard UI with QR code display and link editor
- [x] Middleware for route protection

- Implement link click tracking (not just QR scans)

**Key decisions**:
- Using App Router (not Pages Router)
- PostgreSQL with Prisma ORM for type safety
- Supabase for authentication and database hosting
- Server Components where possible for better performance
- Tailwind CSS v4 for styling
- QR codes use short codes (e.g., /q/abc123) for cleaner URLs
- One QR code per user for MVP simplicity

**Commands used**:
- npx create-next-app@latest . --typescript --eslint --tailwind --src-dir --app --turbo --import-alias "@/*"
- npm install @prisma/client prisma @supabase/supabase-js @supabase/ssr qrcode react-qr-code
- npm install @types/qrcode --save-dev
- npx prisma init
- npx prisma db push
- npm run dev

## Session: 2025-08-14 - Multi‑Domain Phase 1 Implementation & Backfill

**Previous context**: Phase 1 architecture planned (models, APIs, UI). Prisma showed drift due to earlier `db push` state; needed a safe baseline + migration path and data backfill.

**Today's goal**:
- [x] Commit Phase 1 code changes (models/APIs/UI/tenancy utils)
- [x] Add Prisma `directUrl` for safe migrations (non‑pooled)
- [x] Create baseline migration from existing DB (avoid reset)
- [x] Generate/apply Phase 1 migration (Client/Domain + QR tenant fields)
- [x] Add and run one‑time backfill script
- [x] Add docs for domain management (Phase 1)
- [x] Add npm script for backfill and install `tsx`
- [x] Guide domain attachment on Vercel and testing

**Implementation notes**:
- Prisma
  - Added `directUrl = env("DIRECT_DATABASE_URL")` to datasource for migrations through a direct (non‑pooled) connection.
  - Baseline: generated `prisma/migrations/0_init/migration.sql` from live DB, then marked as applied with `prisma migrate resolve`.
  - Created and applied Phase 1 migration `20250814023534_multi_domain_phase1` adding `clients`, `domains`, and `QRCode.clientId/domainId` with FKs and indexes.
- API & UI
  - Implemented Domain Management APIs: `GET/POST /api/domains`, `PATCH /api/domains/:id/primary` (owner‑scoped).
  - Added `DomainManager` in dashboard; badges for Primary/Verified; ability to set primary.
  - Updated `QRCodeManager` with domain selector; QR export encodes `https://<selected-host>/q/<shortCode>`.
  - Utility: `resolveTenant()` server‑side only; `getAppBaseUrl()` and `getQRCodeUrl()` support host override.
- Backfill & Docs
  - Added `scripts/backfill-default-client.ts` to create a Client per User, ensure a primary platform Domain (from `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL`), and set missing `clientId`/`domainId` on existing QR codes.
  - Added `docs/domains.md` with DNS guidance (CNAME for subdomain; A=76.76.21.21 for apex) and Phase 2 verification preview.
  - Added npm script: `backfill:clients` using `tsx`; installed `tsx` as dev dependency.
- Ops & Guidance
  - Ran backfill successfully (created clients/domains; backfilled QRs).
  - Provided step‑by‑step for attaching real domains on Vercel and third‑party DNS (e.g., Namecheap): use CNAME to `cname.vercel-dns.com` for subdomains; avoid Vercel “Redirect to another domain” for QR host.

**Blockers/Issues**:
- Prisma drift due to prior schema without migrations; resolved via baseline migration approach (no data loss).
- `DIRECT_DATABASE_URL` env required for migrate operations; handled by passing env during CLI commands.
- App shows "Pending DNS" (informational only in Phase 1); actual readiness depends on Vercel status and DNS propagation.

**Completed**:
- [x] Client/Domain models added with QR tenant fields
- [x] Prisma migrations: baseline + multi‑domain Phase 1
- [x] Domain APIs (add/list/set primary)
- [x] Dashboard Domain Manager UI
- [x] QR domain selector wired to exports
- [x] Backfill script + executed
- [x] Docs/domains.md + npm script + `tsx` install
- [x] Git commits pushed to `main`

**Next session focus**:
1. Domain verification (Phase 2)
   - Add `verificationToken`, `verifiedAt`, `method` to `Domain`.
   - Endpoints: request verification (TXT/HTTP) + verify check; UI to copy tokens and poll status.
   - Optional: Vercel Domains API integration for automated checks + SSL.
2. Host‑scoped queries
   - Update public routes (`/api/qr/[shortCode]`, `/q/[shortCode]`) to resolve host→client and query `QRCode` by `{ clientId, shortCode }`.
   - Fallback strategies when host not found or not verified.
3. Analytics enrichment
   - Extend `Scan` with `host` and optional `domainId`; capture from request headers; expose filters later.
4. Testing
   - E2E across platform + attached domains; add tests for primary switching and QR export URLs.
5. DNS UX
   - Add in‑app DNS instructions modal and "copy record" helpers; surface Vercel readiness hints.

**References to pending work**:
- Middleware tenant resolution at edge remains out‑of‑scope; keep server‑side `resolveTenant()` for now.
- Verification flow is not implemented; UI shows informational "Pending DNS" only.
- No automatic prevention of unverified domain usage yet; add gating in Phase 2 if required.
- CI/CD for Prisma migrations (prod): consider `prisma migrate deploy` in a protected workflow.

**Commands used**:
- `git add -A && git commit ... && git push`
- `npx prisma migrate diff --from-empty --to-url "$DATABASE_URL" --script > prisma/migrations/0_init/migration.sql`
- `DIRECT_DATABASE_URL="$DATABASE_URL" npx prisma migrate resolve --applied 0_init`
- `DIRECT_DATABASE_URL="$DATABASE_URL" npx prisma migrate dev -n "multi-domain-phase1"`
- `npm i -D tsx` and `npm run backfill:clients`
- Verified Vercel domain attachment and DNS (CNAME/A) configuration

**Ready checklist for operator**:
- Vercel: Domain shows "Ready"; SSL provisioned.
- App: Domain added in Dashboard; set Primary if desired.
- QR export: Encodes selected host; public routes work on attached domain(s).
- Analytics: Scans increment on hits to attached host.

## Session: 2025-08-10 - Multi‑Domain & Custom Domains (Architecture + Phase 1)

**Previous context**: Base URL bug fixed; need to support QR URLs across multiple domains (platform, client subdomains, and client-owned custom domains) with clean routing and good UX.

**Today's goal**:
- [ ] Define data model for tenants and domains (Prisma)
- [ ] Add host-based tenant resolution utility + middleware wiring
- [ ] Extend QR URL builder to support explicit host and primary-domain fallback
- [ ] Scaffold Domain Management APIs (add, list, set primary)
- [ ] Create basic Domain Management UI (add domain, set primary, status)
- [ ] Draft DNS instructions and verification plan (TXT/HTTP) for next phase

**Implementation plan (Phase 1)**:
1. Data model
   - Add `Client` and `Domain` models; link `QRCode.clientId` and optionally `QRCode.domainId` (nullable).
   - Fields: `Domain { id, clientId, hostname, type: ('platform'|'subdomain'|'custom'), verified: boolean, primary: boolean, createdAt, updatedAt }`.
   - Backfill: create a Default Client; associate existing QR codes and platform domain.
2. Tenant resolution
   - `resolveTenant(hostname) -> { clientId, domain }` utility using Prisma.
   - Wire in `src/middleware.ts` to attach resolved tenant via request headers or request attribute.
3. URL builder
   - Update `getQRCodeUrl(shortCode, opts?: { host?: string })` to use:
     - `opts.host` if provided; else tenant primary domain; else `window.location.origin`; else env fallback.
4. API scaffolding
   - `POST /api/domains` (add domain), `GET /api/domains` (list), `PATCH /api/domains/:id/primary` (set primary).
   - AuthZ: only owner can manage domains for their client.
5. UI scaffolding
   - New Dashboard section: Domains.
   - Add domain form (hostname, type), list domains with badges (primary, verified), set primary button.
   - In QR export panel: domain selector (default to primary) with warning if unverified.
6. Docs (internal)
   - Draft DNS guide (CNAME for subdomain, ALIAS/ANAME/A for apex; Vercel examples), verification overview.

**Out of scope this session (Phase 2)**:
- Automated domain verification (DNS TXT or HTTP challenge) and status polling.
- Hosting provider integration (e.g., Vercel Domains API) for verification + SSL provisioning.
- Redirect and link pages fully scoped by `clientId` in all queries (to do after tenant resolution is in place).
- Analytics: capture `host` on scans/clicks.

**Acceptance criteria (Phase 1)**:
- New Prisma models/migrations applied; existing data preserved and mapped to a Default Client.
- Middleware resolves tenant from `Host` and makes it available to handlers.
- `getQRCodeUrl` can produce URLs for a chosen host and defaults to the tenant primary domain.
- Domain Management UI/APIs allow adding domains and marking one as primary (verification is a stub/boolean for now).
- Platform domain behavior remains unchanged; no regressions to existing QR flows.

**Risks/Notes**:
- Migration must be carefully backfilled; add a script or one-time migration step to associate existing QR codes.
- Don’t enable serving unverified custom domains yet; only allow selection in UI with clear warnings.
- Keep admin/auth on platform domain to avoid cross-domain cookie issues.

**Next session focus (Phase 2)**:
1. Domain verification flow (DNS TXT and/or HTTP challenge) with status checks.
2. Provider integration (e.g., Vercel Domains API) to attach domains and provision SSL automatically.
3. Public routes scoping: ensure `/q/[shortCode]` and link pages resolve by `{clientId, shortCode}`.
4. Analytics: store `host` per scan/click; update dashboards to filter by domain.
5. Add E2E tests across platform, subdomain, and custom domain hosts.
6. Add a small “DNS instructions” modal in Domain Manager (copy‑paste records, status hints).

**Questions for next session**:
- Start Phase 2 (verification + host‑scoped queries) immediately, or schedule a follow‑up session after domain onboarding trials?

**Commands planned**:
- `npx prisma migrate dev` (local) / `npx prisma migrate deploy` (prod)
- Optional backfill script: `ts-node scripts/backfill-default-client.ts`
- Run dev and validate: `npm run dev`

**Ready checklist before coding**:
- Confirm hosting strategy (Vercel vs self-host) to tailor DNS docs.
- Confirm desired default behavior when no primary domain is set (fallback to platform domain).

**Important note**:
- Middleware remains lean (no DB access at Edge). Tenant resolution is currently server-side via `resolveTenant()`; public QR routes continue to work without host-scoped queries until Phase 2.

**Next steps (operator checklist)**:
- Apply DB changes: `npx prisma generate` then `npx prisma migrate dev -n "multi-domain-phase1"` (dev) / `npx prisma migrate deploy` (prod).
- Deploy the app so the new APIs/UI are available.
- Attach custom domain in hosting (e.g., Vercel → Project Settings → Domains). Add CNAME/ALIAS per instructions and wait for SSL “Ready”.
- In Dashboard → Domains: add the same hostname, set as Primary.
- In QR section: choose “Domain to encode” (defaults to primary), export SVG/PNG, and replace any old images.

**How it works now**:
- New QR exports encode `https://<selected-domain>/q/<shortCode>`.
- Next.js serves `/q/[shortCode]` on any attached domain; Phase 2 will enforce tenant scoping `{ clientId, shortCode }` and add verification.
- URL builder supports an explicit host override and otherwise defaults to current origin/env fallback.

## Session: 2025-08-02 23:30 - Playwright Testing Implementation & Authentication Flow

## Session: 2025-01-04 - Dynamic QR Code & Advanced Customization Features

**Previous context**: E2E testing infrastructure completed, was planning CI/CD pipeline

**Today's goal**: 
- [x] Implement dynamic QR code destination editing (diverted from planned CI/CD work)
- [x] Add comprehensive QR code customization features
- [x] Implement logo upload and management
- [x] Add visual styling options (colors, corners, shapes)
- [x] Create QR code scannability validation system
- [x] Build professional export functionality

**Implementation notes**:

### Dynamic QR Code Destination:
- Added `redirectType` and `redirectUrl` fields to QRCode model
- QR codes can redirect to:
  - "links" mode: Linktree-style page with multiple links (default)
  - "url" mode: Direct redirect to any custom URL
- Updated `/q/[shortCode]` route to handle both redirect types
- Added scan tracking before redirects
- Created destination editing UI in QRCodeManager component

### Logo Upload Feature:
- Implemented Supabase Storage integration for logo uploads
- Server-side upload with service role key to bypass RLS policies
- Added `logoUrl`, `logoSize`, and `logoShape` fields to database
- Created LogoUploader component with size controls
- Supports PNG, JPG, SVG formats (max 2MB)
- Logo displayed in center of QR code with proper excavation

### QR Code Styling:
- **Rounded Corners**: 0-10 scale (0-50% rounding) with QRStyleControls component
- **Custom Colors**: Full color picker for QR modules (fgColor)
- **Preset Colors**: Quick selection of 8 professional color options
- **Logo Shape**: Square/Circle options (circle feature limited by library)
- Real-time preview of all customizations

### Export Functionality:
- **SVG Export**: Scalable vector format for designers
- **PNG Export**: Multiple resolutions (512px, 1024px, 2048px, 4K)
- **Transparent Background**: Toggle between transparent and white
- Uses html-to-image library for accurate DOM capture
- Fixed scaling issues for proper export dimensions

### QR Code Scannability Validation:
- Created comprehensive validation system (`qr-validation.ts`)
- Risk assessment based on:
  - Logo size (optimal < 20%, max 30%, critical > 35%)
  - Corner radius (optimal < 15%, max 25%, critical > 40%)
  - Color contrast ratio calculations
  - Combined risk factors
- Visual warnings with risk levels (Low, Medium, High, Critical)
- Auto-adjustment feature for safe values
- Real-time feedback in UI controls

**Technical Challenges Resolved**:
- **Supabase Storage RLS**: Used service role key for server-side uploads
- **Logo Transparency**: Preserved original PNG transparency without white background
- **Export Scaling**: Fixed pixelRatio settings for correct dimensions
- **Circular Excavation**: Library limitation - only square excavation supported
- **Color Contrast**: Added validation to ensure scannable QR codes

**Database Schema Updates**:
```prisma
model QRCode {
  redirectType  String   @default("links")
  redirectUrl   String?
  logoUrl       String?
  logoSize      Int      @default(30)
  logoShape     String   @default("square")
  cornerRadius  Int      @default(0)
  fgColor       String   @default("#000000")
}
```
